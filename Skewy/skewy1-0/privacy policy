Skewy uses the microphone (recorded) data to evaluate the general sound level and frequencies in the inaudible (17.8 to 20 kHz) range.
The data is only recorded when Recorder function is turned on.

Data, which is saved (in an SQLite database within the app, found in the Alarm tab):
- Spectograms which are simple bitmaps consiting of 0s, 1s and 2s (no actual sound data)
- Event when Skewy's recorder function is turned off.
- Event when the measured sound drops below the alarm value.

No other data is saved. No data is accessed, evaluated or relayed. No location information, no internet required. No advertising.

All data can be deleted in the Alarms tab by pressing indididual entries. To delete all, press and hold any delete button for a short time.
